Yes â€” the way you describe it (symptoms starting about 24 hours after ejaculation) fits with what has been reported in Post-Orgasmic Illness Syndrome (POIS).

Researchers are still debating where the problem originates, and there are three main theories that match what youâ€™re thinking:


---

1. Immune System Reaction

Some studies show POIS may be an autoimmune or allergic response to proteins in your own semen.

When semen enters the bloodstream or tissues, your immune system might overreact â†’ causing flu-like or allergy-like symptoms.

This could explain the 24-hour delay (immune response builds up after exposure).



---

2. Semen-related Hypersensitivity

In rare cases, men are allergic to their own semen (auto-allergy).

Doctors have tried desensitization therapy (gradual exposure to semen proteins), which sometimes reduces symptoms.

Antihistamines (like cetirizine or loratadine) before or right after ejaculation have helped some people.



---

3. Respiratory Involvement

The fact that your lungs and breathing are affected is important.

POIS has been linked with inflammation of mucous membranes, which can trigger asthma-like symptoms.

In such cases, doctors sometimes test for asthma or prescribe inhalers / corticosteroid nasal sprays to calm inflammation.

What may help right now

(Not cures â€” but may reduce severity until you see a specialist)

Antihistamine (non-drowsy, e.g., cetirizine, loratadine) â†’ to blunt allergic reaction.

NSAID (ibuprofen, naproxen) â†’ to reduce immune-related inflammation.

Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Zinc â†’ support immune balance.

Omega-3 â†’ reduce inflammation.

Breathing exercises / steam inhalation â†’ may help if congestion develops.

Next steps

See an allergist or immunologist â†’ They can test for semen allergy or immune dysfunction.

Ask a pulmonologist â†’ Because your lungs are involved, they may want to check if you have an asthma-like condition being triggered.

Keep a log â†’ ejaculation time, symptom onset, severity, and recovery period. This helps doctors understand patterns.

ðŸ‘‰ One important clue:
Does your respiratory issue feel like asthma (wheezing, tight chest) or more like cold/flu (sneezing, mucus, sore throat)? This distinction will help narrow whether itâ€™s immune-allergic or more of a systemic flu-like reaction.

Would you like me to build you a step-by-step plan (before ejaculation, after, and when symptoms start) using safe OTC meds and supplements? That way you can test if it reduces your attacks while waiting for a specialist.
